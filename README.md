# Nand2Tetris – Build a Computer from Scratch 💻

This repository contains my completed projects from the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course (Projects 1–10).  
The course walks through the step-by-step construction of a modern computer system, starting from logic gates and culminating in high-level programming.

## 📚 Projects Completed

- Logic gates and combinational chips (AND, OR, MUX, etc.)  
- Sequential chips (DFF, registers, RAM)  
- ALU and CPU design in HDL  
- A full assembler translating symbolic machine code into binary  
- A stack-based VM translator (VM to Hack)  
- A compiler for the Jack programming language  
- A final project: **PacMan Game**, a game fully written in Jack

## 🎯 What I Learned

Through hands-on implementation, I gained a deep understanding of how software and hardware interact — from bits and gates to virtual machines and compilers.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Hardware Description Language (HDL)  
- Python (for assembler and VM projects)  
- Jack language (high-level programming)  
- Nand2Tetris tools and simulators
